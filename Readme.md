This project entails the building of a Random Forest Machine Learning model around a Loan data, a deep learning Neural Net was also implemented in other to compare accuracy and decide which one is a better fit for the model.
Before building the model, a comprehensive data analysis and visualization was carried out (you'll love it) on the data in other to get full insight about the data. I am currently building a web app for this project so that it can be freely accessible to people who would want to check their loan status before applying for a loan on any platform. 
************So, check back, this repo will soon be updated.***************
